# Rust Raytacing

I'm following the famous raytracing in a weekend tutorial/challenge 

Currently the program outputs an image format, which you place into a file by running the terminal command

```bash
cargo run > image.ppm
```
I will update this image to display the progress i have made
(For a more up-to-date version, see the .ppm file)
